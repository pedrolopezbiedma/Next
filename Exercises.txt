Lets add some logic to the EventSearch

- Put a onSubmit method within the form ( preventDefault )
- Get the value of the dropdown with useRef ( C'mon, use them, you hate them, you love them )
- Now, in the parent component there will be a method to react to this, passed as a props to the Event Search. Call that method.
- In the parent method, then navigate to events/year/month
- Test that when navigating, it goes to the filtered page.

- get the values for the year & month from the url
- use the proper method to get the events. ( Checking first if we do have filters, if not we have <p> Loading<p> with class 'center')
- Check if no filteres, then return some message
- use the event list with the obtained events
- Download the zip and use the Results Title compoment above the Event list  ( date, removes a month )
