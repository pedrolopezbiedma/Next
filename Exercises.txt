- Now lets works in the Event Detail page
- Use the event by the ID from the dummy data ( methods )
    - If you you don't find any element, just return a <p>No found event</p> ( for now )
    - Download the already created components
    - For the content
        - fragment
        - EventSummary
        - Event logistics
        - Event content
            - as children, a <p> with the event.description we have
        - Check what the components needs to use the props
- Test that everything is working

- The idea here is to use that component within the main layout, hence, within _app.js
- To do this:
    - We will create a header component that will return
        - header
            <div>
                Link with text NextEvents and go to the starting page
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li> with a Link to All Events and test All Events
            Download the css file for the component

    - We will create a layout component that will have a
        fragment
            Header we have created
            <main>
                {props.children}

    - Use the layout within the _app.js

- Now lets go to all events page.
- Get all events from the dummy data file
- Reuse the EventList component to render all the events

--- Video 258 ---
- We are going to create a component to filter for the events within the all events page. ( Event Search )
-In the JSX
    - Form
        <div>
            <div>
                <label> for year
                <select> id year ( 2023, 2024 ) / Update the date in the dummy data

            <div>
                <label> for month
                <select> for months
            Button component with text Find Events
- We need to update the button compoment to be a real button instead of a link
    -Check if there is link
        If not, return a button, pass the onclick tb and set classes to btn
- Download the styles for the Event Search
- Put this new component in the All Events page.

Lets add some logic to the EventSearch

- Put a onSubmit method within the form ( preventDefault )
- Get the value of the dropdown with useRef ( C'mon, use them, you hate them, you love them )
- Now, in the parent component there will be a method to react to this, passed as a props to the Event Search. Call that method.
- In the parent method, then navigate to events/year/month
- Test that when navigating, it goes to the filtered page.

--- Video 260 & 261 ---
- get the values for the year & month from the url
- use the proper method to get the events. ( Checking first if we do have filters, if not we have <p> Loading<p> with class 'center')
- Check if no filteres, then return some message
- use the event list with the obtained events
- Download the zip and use the Results Title compoment above the Event list  ( date, removes a month )
